    <p>Cacio e Pepe is a legendary Roman dish of spaghetti, Pecorino cheese, and black pepper. It uses the starchy pasta
        water to create a deceptively rich and creamy sauce. It is simple to make but delivers a sophisticated, salty,
        and spicy flavor.</p>
    <h2>Ingredient</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 oz spaghetti or bucatini</li>

        <li>1 cup finely grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon coarsely ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook Pasta: Boil pasta until very al dente (a couple of minutes less than package instructions). Reserve about
        1.5 cups of the starchy cooking water, then drain the pasta.</li>

        <li>Toast Pepper: In the empty pot, toast the ground pepper over medium heat for about one minute until fragrant.</li>

        <li>Make Paste: Turn off the heat. Add ½ cup of the reserved hot pasta water to the pot and scrape up the pepper. In
        a separate bowl, mix the Pecorino Romano with about ¼ cup of the reserved water to create a creamy paste.</li>

        <li>Combine: Add the pasta to the pot with the pepper water. Slowly mix in the cheese paste, tossing constantly. Add
        more reserved pasta water a tablespoon at a time until a smooth, creamy sauce coats the noodles. Serve
        immediately.</li>
    </ol>
